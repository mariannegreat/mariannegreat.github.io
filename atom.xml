    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In solving homework #2, I had to understand <em>attr_accessor</em>. (Side note: I&rsquo;m slowly learning that a &ldquo;method&rdquo; is essentially a function &mdash; a weird piece of terminology that I haven&rsquo;t been able to get used to, for some reason.)</p>

<p>In the future, I think I&rsquo;ll start taking screenshots of my in-progress, error-prone code as I do my homework. For now, here&rsquo;s some things that I struggled with but figured out while solving last week&rsquo;s Homework #2.</p>

<p>An errant code sample:</p>

<pre><code>class Story
    attr_accessor :title
    attr_accessor :category

    def initialize title, category 
        @title = title
        @category = category
    end

    def upvotes
        1
    end

    def upvote
        upvotes = upvotes + 1
    end

    def downvote
        upvotes = upvotes - 1
    end
end
</code></pre>

<p>After setting <em>story = Story.new</em>, <em>story.upvotes</em> DID return a value of 1. But I didn&rsquo;t make <em>upvotes</em> writable… whoops.</p>

<p>I guess I thought that <em>upvote</em> and <em>downvote</em> would be able to access the <em>upvotes</em> method to return the right values.</p>

<p>So… the key to figuring out the problem was to make @upvotes a variable! Duh.</p>

<pre><code>attr_accessor :upvotes
</code></pre>

<p><em>attr_accessor</em> essentially creates a method called <em>upvotes</em> that returns the value of a variable <em>upvotes</em> (reader), and a method <em>upvotes=</em> that allowed the variable <em>upvotes</em> to be rewritten (writer).</p>

<p>According to the requirements of the homework, <em>upvotes</em> needed to be set at a value of 1 upon initialization. To be honest, I don&rsquo;t know if the placement of attr_accessor above or below the initialize method makes a difference. But it did need to be set as 1, so I put that in the initialize function:</p>

<pre><code>def initialize title, category 
  @title = title
  @category = category
  @upvotes = 1
end
</code></pre>

<p>Of course, it doesn&rsquo;t need to be set as an argument since the user is not defining it.</p>

<p>From there it was a simple matter of creating the <em>upvote</em> and <em>downvote</em> methods. (Ugh, I always want to say &ldquo;function&rdquo; &mdash; I&rsquo;m gonna need to get used to that.)</p>

<p>After totally botching the first repo, Eddie calmly (&ldquo;It&rsquo;s going to be okay&rdquo;) helped me destroy my local octopress folder and github.io repo, and set it up all over again. Thank you Eddie.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s hope the second time is the last first post!</p>
