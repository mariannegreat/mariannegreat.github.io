**About Me**

I am a front-end web developer who would love to get better at the back-end stuff! 

I build a lot of websites on Shopify, an e-commerce platform. Shopify's out-of-the-box features are limited, so my goal for the class is to build a "wishlist" app for Shopify, that will integrate with Shopify's Customer and Product APIs.
